Relax the shoulders, jaw, and eyes. If it is not comfortable to place the forehead on the floor, rest it on a block or two stacked fists. There is an energy point at the center of the forehead in between the eyebrows that stimulates the vagus nerve and supports a response. Finding a comfortable place for the forehead is key to gaining this soothing benefit.\nThere are several possible arm variations. You can stretch your arms in front of you with the palms toward the floor or bring your arms back alongside your thighs with the palms facing upwards. These are the most common variations. But you can also stretch the arms forward with palms facing up for a shoulder release or try bending the elbows so that the palms touch and rest the thumbs at the back of the neck. In this position inch the elbows forward.\nDo whichever feel more comfortable for you. If you've been doing a lot of shoulder work, the second option feels nice.\nStay as long as you like, eventually reconnecting with the steady inhales and exhales of your breath."

Keep the left leg strong and rotated slightly inward; ground the head of the thigh bone into the floor. Press the back of the left heel and the base of the big toe away from the pelvis. Also press the inner right foot actively into the floor, but soften the inner right groin to receive the pubis as you twist. Grounding the straight-leg thigh and bent-knee foot will help you lengthen your spine, which is always the first prerequisite of a successful twist.\nWith an exhalation, rotate your torso to the right and wrap your left arm around the right thigh. Hold the outer thigh with your left hand, then pull the thigh up as you release the right hip toward the floor. Press your right fingertips onto the floor just behind your pelvis to lift the torso slightly up and forward.\nRemember to keep your straight leg and bent-knee foot grounded. Sink the inner right groin deeper into the pelvis, then lengthen your front belly up out of the groin along the inner right thigh. Continue lengthening the spine with each inhalation, and twist a little more with each exhalation. Hug the thigh to your belly, then lean back against your shoulder blades into an upper-back backbend. Gently turn your head to the right to complete the twist in your cervical spine.\nStay in the pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Then release with an exhalation, reverse the legs and twist to the left for an equal length of time."

Also press the inner right foot actively into the floor, but soften the inner right groin to receive the pubis as you twist. Grounding the straight-leg thigh and bent-knee foot will help you lengthen your spine, which is always the first prerequisite of a successful twist.\nWith an exhalation, rotate your torso to the right and wrap your left arm around the right thigh. Hold the outer thigh with your left hand, then pull the thigh up as you release the right hip toward the floor. Press your right fingertips onto the floor just behind your pelvis to lift the torso slightly up and forward.\nRemember to keep your straight leg and bent-knee foot grounded. Sink the inner right groin deeper into the pelvis, then lengthen your front belly up out of the groin along the inner right thigh. Continue lengthening the spine with each inhalation, and twist a little more with each exhalation. Hug the thigh to your belly, then lean back against your shoulder blades into an upper-back backbend. Gently turn your head to the right to complete the twist in your cervical spine.\nStay in the pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Then release with an exhalation, reverse the legs and twist to the left for an equal length of time."

Turn your palms to face upwards but don't try to keep them open. Let the fingers curl in.\nTuck your shoulder blades onto your back for support. This is a similar movement to tucking the shoulders under in Bridge Pose, but less intense.\nOnce you have set up your limbs, release any effort from holding them in position. Relax your whole body, including your face. Let your body feel heavy.\nLet your breathing occur naturally. If your mind wanders, you can bring your attention to your breath but try to just notice it, not deepen it.\nStay for a minimum of five minutes. Ten minutes is better. If you are practicing at home, set an alarm so that you are not compelled to keep checking the time.\nTo come out, first begin to the deepen your breath. Then begin to wiggle your fingers and toes6﻿ , slowly reawakening your body.\nStretch your arms overhead for a full body stretch from hands to feet.\nBring your knees into your chest and roll over to one side, keeping your eyes closed. Use your bottom arm as a pillow while you rest in a fetal position7﻿ for a few breaths.\nUsing your hands for support, bring yourself back up into a sitting position."

It's often the first inversion that yoga beginners tackle because it's much more stable than a headstand or handstand. However, there are serious risks associated with doing Shoulderstand, so it's important to set up the pose correctly for the safest possible experience.",

Press firmly into the palms using them as leverage to lift onto the balls of the feet and extend one leg up. Bend at the elbows, place your hands on your low back creating a shelf, and then extend the next leg up.\nOnce you raise the legs, don't turn your head to the side to look around the room, since you can injure your neck. Keep your gaze upward and your neck straight.\nLift up through the balls of your feet. Walk your hands further up the back for more stability. Feel the chest reaching towards the chin to support opening the upper back.\nMove your hips toward the front of the room and your feet toward the back of the room to straighten the body. The correct alignment is with the hips over the shoulders and feet over the hips. Ask your teacher or a friend to help you determine if your legs are perpendicular to the floor.\nStay in the pose for up to 10 breaths.\nTo come out, bring your feet back over your head to come through Plow Pose.\nRoll out from Plow slowly."

By lifting your torso up and backward, the chest is opened and the back is deeply stretched. This pose is a great way to deeply stretch the back after a long day of hunching over. This yoga pose can be performed as part of your regular practice or within a sequence of back stretches. After your body is warmed up from some standing and floor poses, perform Bow Pose.

This yoga pose also opens up the neck, shoulders, and abdomen. It improves flexibility in the back and encourages balance in the core and chest. If you have a stiff back, Bow Pose may be beneficial.

In this pose, you discover how the coming together of two opposing energies generates a power that is greater than its separate parts. In Half Moon Pose, two opposing movements are happening at once: You are rooting down into the earth with your standing leg while simultaneously lifting and extending your raised leg into space. The meeting of these two forces—rooting down and extending out—gives you the power to balance and suspend your spine and torso in midair. The pose teaches coordination and can help you understand the interdependence of the actions in your body.

Keep the left leg strong and rotated slightly inward; ground the head of the thigh bone into the floor. Press the back of the left heel and the base of the big toe away from the pelvis. Also press the inner right foot actively into the floor, but soften the inner right groin to receive the pubis as you twist. Grounding the straight-leg thigh and bent-knee foot will help you lengthen your spine, which is always the first prerequisite of a successful twist.\nWith an exhalation, rotate your torso to the right and wrap your left arm around the right thigh. Hold the outer thigh with your left hand, then pull the thigh up as you release the right hip toward the floor. Press your right fingertips onto the floor just behind your pelvis to lift the torso slightly up and forward.\nRemember to keep your straight leg and bent-knee foot grounded. Sink the inner right groin deeper into the pelvis, then lengthen your front belly up out of the groin along the inner right thigh. Continue lengthening the spine with each inhalation, and twist a little more with each exhalation. Hug the thigh to your belly, then lean back against your shoulder blades into an upper-back backbend. Gently turn your head to the right to complete the twist in your cervical spine.\nStay in the pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Then release with an exhalation, reverse the legs and twist to the left for an equal length of time."

This yoga pose can be performed as part of your regular practice or within a sequence of back stretches. After your body is warmed up from some standing and floor poses, perform Bow Pose.

This yoga pose also opens up the neck, shoulders, and abdomen. It improves flexibility in the back and encourages balance in the core and chest. If you have a stiff back, Bow Pose may be beneficial.
